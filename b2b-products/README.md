# 💼 B2B Products

Business-to-Business software and tools. This is where you build applications for companies and organizations.

## What is B2B?
B2B (Business-to-Business) products are software tools that businesses use to:
- Manage operations
- Automate processes
- Analyze data
- Collaborate with teams
- Serve their customers

**Examples**: Salesforce, Slack, Shopify, Stripe, Mailchimp

## What You'll Build Here
- SaaS (Software as a Service) applications
- Internal business tools
- APIs for other businesses
- Admin dashboards
- Customer management systems
- Analytics platforms
